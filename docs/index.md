## Features

This project implements utilities for a very
broad range of use-cases and packages.

As such, fully installing everything may not
be the route you want to go.

The following features are supported:

| :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| SQLAlchemy Utilities       | *sqla*      | *sqla*      |
| GoogleCloudPlatform Extras | *google*    | *google*    |
| General Utilities          | -           | -           |
| Testing Utilities          | -           | -           |

All feature-sets without an addition "extra-name",
are included in the minimal installation.
